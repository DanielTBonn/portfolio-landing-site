# Portfolio Landing Site

## Description

As an aspiring web developer, I needed to create a space to show off the skills I developed on my coding journey. To do so I have set up a portfolio website showing off some of my recent projects as well as giving an idea of what level of HTML/CSS competenece I have achieved. 

I spent a great deal of time learning how to properly use flexbox and how its children elements relate to it. Google was an essential tool that I learned to rely on when determining syntax of some CSS properties as well as inspiration for how to format my website. I believe these skills will help me in my effort to learn programming.
